ðŸ‘‹ Hello there. This is GitHub environment created by Eaindra for ATNI. As this is not a full-on GitHub account for developers, there will be limited features available.
However, this is a codespace created to document and share with other members of the data team so welcome aboard! I have documented the program that I have written as much as I can, 
in jupyternotebooks or python/readme's but let me know if there's any question!
